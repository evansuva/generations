# About Us

### Mission Statement

Maria Montessori observed that a child’s learning begins at birth. At
Generations Montessori School, we believe this to be true. The infant
environment is designed to help children 2&ndash;20 months old begin to
define their own strengths and personalities. The toddler classroom is
set up to assist children as they continue to grow, learn, and develop
their confidence and independence. In each classroom, children will
have access to a variety of age appropriate materials centered on
movement and coordination, language development, and cognitive
growth. Materials are specifically chosen to help students advance
socially while developing fine and gross motor skills. Teachers at
Generations Montessori School strive to lead with compassion, love,
and respect. Students are encouraged to gain independence through
trust, positive social interactions, and intellectual growth. At
Generations Montessori School, we believe that children are
independent thinkers, capable of making choices and worthy of respect.

Education is a natural process carried out by the child
and is not acquired by listening to words but by experiences in the
environment. <div class="sidequotee">Maria Montessori</div>
