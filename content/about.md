Education is a natural process carried out by the child
and is not acquired by listening to words but by experiences in the
environment. <div class="sidequotee">Maria Montessori</div>

### Center Philosophy

Maria Montessori observed that a child’s learning begins at birth. At
Generations Montessori School, we believe this to be true. The infant
environment is designed to help children 2-20 months old begin to define
their own strengths and personalities. Children will have access to a
variety of age appropriate materials centered on movement and
coordination, language development, and cognitive growth. Materials are
specifically chosen to help students advance socially while developing
fine and gross motor skills. Teachers at Generations Montessori School
lead with compassion, love, and respect. Students are encouraged to gain
independence through trust, positive social interactions, and
intellectual growth. At Generations Montessori School, we believe that
children are independent thinkers, capable of making choices and worthy
of respect.
