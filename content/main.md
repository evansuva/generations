After a successful first year infant class, we are pleased to offer 2
classes for the upcoming school year: an infant class for
children ages 2 &ndash; 20 months old and a toddler class for children
21 months &ndash; 3 years of age. Our goal is to provide an
environment that children can join as early as 2 months old and stay
through their kindergarten year.
