During the 2016-2017 school year, Generations Montessori School will be
offering an infant class for children ages 2-20 months old. The hope is
that as your children grow, the school will grow with them. Students
will be able to enroll as early as 2 months old and continue on through
their kindergarten year.

### Center Philosophy

   <div class="sidequote">
   _Education is a natural process carried out by the child
and is not acquired by listening to words but by experiences in the
environment._
   <div class="sidequotee">Maria Montessori</div>
   </div>

Maria Montessori observed that a child’s learning begins at birth. At
Generations Montessori School, we believe this to be true. The infant
environment is designed to help children 2-20 months old begin to define
their own strengths and personalities. Children will have access to a
variety of age appropriate materials centered on movement and
coordination, language development, and cognitive growth. Materials are
specifically chosen to help students advance socially while developing
fine and gross motor skills. Teachers at Generations Montessori School
lead with compassion, love, and respect. Students are encouraged to gain
independence through trust, positive social interactions, and
intellectual growth. At Generations Montessori School, we believe that
children are independent thinkers, capable of making choices and worthy
of respect.

   I have worked in early childhood education for nearly 30 years. In that
   time, I have cared for over a hundred children in the Charlottesville
   area. Most importantly, I love working with young children as they
   first begin to develop their individual personalities. I have my
   Infant and Toddler Certification from the American Montessori
   Society, and I believe each child develops in a way that is unique to
   him or her. I specialize in creating educational environments for
   infants and toddlers that foster growth and independence, and my goal
   is to work with parents to fully meet their child’s unique cognitive,
   emotional, social and physical needs.  </td>

  <centeR><b>Christina Pace</b></center> After growing up in
   Charlottesville and attending the city school system, I earned my
   Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from Virginia Polytechnic
   and State University. I continued my education at the College of
   William and Mary, where I earned my Masters in Education with an
   emphasis in Gifted Education. Since returning to Charlottesville, I
   have worked at Village School and Tandem Friends School. I became a
   mother in September of 2015, and found the perfect reason to finally
   fulfill my mom and my dream to begin our own school. Together, the
   three of us paved the way for Generations Montessori School.  </td>
