# Enrollment

Generations Montessori School is pleased to offer 3 classes for the 2018 &ndash; 2019 school year: an infant class for children ages 2 &ndash; 20 months old, a toddler class for children 21 months &ndash; 3 years of age, and a Children's House for children 3 &ndash; 6 years of age. Our goal is to provide an environment that children can join as early as 2 months old and stay through their kindergarten year.
