   I have worked in early childhood education for nearly 30 years. In that
   time, I have cared for over a hundred children in the Charlottesville
   area. Most importantly, I love working with young children as they
   first begin to develop their individual personalities. I have my
   Infant and Toddler Certification from the American Montessori
   Society, and I believe each child develops in a way that is unique to
   him or her. I specialize in creating educational environments for
   infants and toddlers that foster growth and independence, and my goal
   is to work with parents to fully meet their childâ€™s unique cognitive,
   emotional, social and physical needs.  </td>

  <centeR><b>Christina Pace</b></center> After growing up in
   Charlottesville and attending the city school system, I earned my
   Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from Virginia Polytechnic
   and State University. I continued my education at the College of
   William and Mary, where I earned my Masters in Education with an
   emphasis in Gifted Education. Since returning to Charlottesville, I
   have worked at Village School and Tandem Friends School. I became a
   mother in September of 2015, and found the perfect reason to finally
   fulfill my mom and my dream to begin our own school. Together, the
   three of us paved the way for Generations Montessori School.  </td>
