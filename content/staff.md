   I have worked in early childhood education for nearly 30 years. In that
   time, I have cared for over a hundred children in the Charlottesville
   area. Most importantly, I love working with young children as they
   first begin to develop their individual personalities. I have my
   Infant and Toddler Certification from the American Montessori
   Society, and I believe each child develops in a way that is unique to
   him or her. I specialize in creating educational environments for
   infants and toddlers that foster growth and independence, and my goal
   is to work with parents to fully meet their child’s unique cognitive,
   emotional, social and physical needs.  </td>

  <centeR><b><font size="+2">Christina Pace</font></b></center> After growing up in
   Charlottesville and attending the city school system, I earned my
   Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from Virginia Polytechnic
   and State University. I continued my education at the College of
   William and Mary, where I earned my Masters in Education with an
   emphasis in Gifted Education. Since returning to Charlottesville, I
   have worked at Village School and Tandem Friends School. I became a
   mother in September of 2015, and found the perfect reason to finally
   fulfill my mom and my dream to begin our own school. Together, the
   three of us paved the way for Generations Montessori School.  </td>

I am a Charlottesville native who grew up in a homeschooling community. I attended Tandem Friends School, and after graduating I worked in the sheep industry in much of the Midwest of the US.  I am currently in a training program to receive my Infant and Toddler Montessori Certification, and enjoy seeing the development of young children within a Montessori setting.

I recently graduated from Providence College, where I earned my
Bachelor of Arts degree in History, and during my four years there I
became active in a number of programs that worked with children. I
enjoy working with infants and toddlers in particular because not only
are these some of the most critical years of their lives but I love
seeing how each child's interests develop. In every way these children
are growing and to have the opportunity to be a part of that growth is
a special thing.

I have worked with children of all ages for over a decade.  While studying English and education at the University of Virginia, I spent summers working as a camp counselor, both leading outdoor trips with middle school students and teaching yoga to children from ages three to twelve.  I worked at The Village School and Tandem Friends School while completing my teaching licensure at Mary Baldwin College, and for the last six years I have taught English in both Greene County and Albemarle County Public Schools.  I also have a Calming Kids yoga certification and love doing yoga with children.  Since becoming a mother in the spring of 2017, my focus has shifted to infant and early childhood development, and I am currently working towards completing my Montessori teacher training through the North American Montessori Center.  I am so excited and thankful to be a part of the Generations Montessori School community.
