# Enrichment Days

During the school year, we offer Enrichment Days for children when
schools are closed.

**Full STEAM Ahead** is a hands on introduction to science,
technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics for 3-12 year old
students. Throughout the week, students will work with instructors to
begin to develop hypotheses, conduct experiments, and make conclusions
based on simple data. Students will be encouraged to work together and
think creatively when presented with design problems. A healthy snack
will be provided daily, but students will need to bring a nut-free
lunch each day.
